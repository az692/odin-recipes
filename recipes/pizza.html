    <p class="intro">Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based
        dough topped with
        tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally
        in a
        wood-fired oven.</p>
        
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand
            mixer
            fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5
            minutes
            before serving.</li>
